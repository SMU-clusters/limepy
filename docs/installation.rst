Installation
============

At the command line::

    $ git clone https://github.com/mgieles/limepy.git
    $ cd limepy
    $ python setup.py install

or::
    $ pip install -e ./ 

If you do not have root access on the machine you can do a local installation using easy_install:
 
    $ easy_install --prefix=$HOME/mypthonpath ./

Make sure that you have added the directory $HOME/mypthonpath/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ to your PYTHONPATH variable
